# Project Overview

## Overview

The **Deribit FIX Client** is a high-performance, type-safe implementation of the FIX 4.4 protocol specifically designed for trading on Deribit cryptocurrency exchange. Built in Rust, it provides a robust foundation for algorithmic trading, market making, and institutional trading operations.

## What is FIX?

**FIX (Financial Information eXchange)** is a messaging standard used by financial institutions for electronic trading. It enables:

- **Real-time trading**: Execute orders with minimal latency
- **Market data**: Subscribe to live price feeds and order book updates
- **Position management**: Track and manage trading positions
- **Risk management**: Implement sophisticated risk controls
- **Institutional integration**: Connect to professional trading systems

## Why Rust?

- **Performance**: Near C++ performance with memory safety
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees prevent runtime errors
- **Concurrency**: Async/await support for high-frequency trading
- **Zero-cost Abstractions**: High-level APIs without performance overhead
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of async and networking libraries

## Key Features

### ✅ **Implemented Features**
- **Session Management**: Logon, logout, heartbeat, sequence management
- **Market Data**: Real-time order book, trades, and instrument information with complete snapshot support including funding/index fields
- **Order Management**: Place, cancel, modify, and manage trading orders
- **Security Information**: Complete instrument definitions and status updates
- **Position Management**: Full position tracking with dedicated builders for emission and parsing
- **Quote Management**: Mass quotes with optional standard FIX repeating groups support
- **RFQ System**: Request for quote functionality
- **Trade Reporting**: Complete trade capture and reporting
- **User Management**: User request/response handling
- **Risk Management**: Market maker protection and limits
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and handling

### 🚧 **In Development**
- **Block Trading**: Large volume execution improvements
- **Analytics**: Performance metrics and reporting
- **WebSocket Bridge**: Real-time notifications

### 📋 **Planned Features**
- **Advanced Risk Controls**: Enhanced position limits and risk management
- **Performance Optimization**: Further latency improvements
- **Extended Market Data**: Additional data feeds and analytics
