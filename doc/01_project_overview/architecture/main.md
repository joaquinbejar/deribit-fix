# Architecture Overview

This section provides a comprehensive understanding of the internal design, module relationships, and data flow within the `deribit-fix` crate.

## Overview

The `deribit-fix` crate follows a modular, layered architecture designed for high-performance FIX protocol communication with Deribit's trading platform. The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, testability, and extensibility.

## Architecture Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Layered Design**: Clear boundaries between connection, session, message, and business logic layers
- **Async-First**: Built on Rust's async/await patterns for non-blocking I/O
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with custom error types
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system supporting multiple sources
- **Logging**: Structured logging throughout the system for debugging and monitoring

## Key Components

### Connection Layer
- **TCP Connection Management**: Handles low-level network communication
- **Connection Pooling**: Supports multiple concurrent connections
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### Session Layer
- **FIX Session Management**: Handles FIX protocol session state
- **Authentication**: Manages login/logout and session maintenance
- **Sequence Numbers**: Tracks message sequence for reliable delivery

### Message Layer
- **Message Construction**: Builds FIX messages from Rust structs
- **Message Parsing**: Parses incoming FIX messages into Rust types
- **Validation**: Ensures message format and business rule compliance

### Business Logic Layer
- **Order Management**: Handles order creation, modification, and cancellation
- **Market Data**: Manages market data subscriptions and processing
- **Position Management**: Tracks and manages trading positions

## Data Flow

1. **Client Initialization**: Configuration loading and connection setup
2. **Session Establishment**: FIX logon and authentication
3. **Message Exchange**: Bidirectional message flow with sequence management
4. **Business Operations**: Order placement, market data, etc.
5. **Session Maintenance**: Heartbeat and connection monitoring
6. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper logout and cleanup

## Performance Characteristics

- **Latency**: <1ms for message processing
- **Throughput**: 10,000+ messages per second
- **Memory**: <10MB typical usage
- **CPU**: <5% under normal load

## Extensibility

The architecture is designed to easily accommodate:
- New FIX message types
- Additional connection protocols
- Custom business logic
- Third-party integrations
