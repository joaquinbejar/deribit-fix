//! TEST 31: EMPTY POSITIONS REPORT
//!
//! This test handles the scenario of having no open positions:
//! 1. Ensure the account has no open positions.
//! 2. Send a `RequestForPositions` (AN).
//! 3. Receive a `PositionReport` (AP) that correctly indicates zero positions,
//!    likely via a specific `PosReqResult` or an empty repeating group.
